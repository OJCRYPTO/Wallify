# Wallify
Wallify fetches the album art from your currently playing Spotify track and quickly transforms it into a stunning wallpaper for your Mac. The app dynamically creates rich gradients enhanced with advanced dithering and noise filters, all based on the color palette extracted directly from the album art.
