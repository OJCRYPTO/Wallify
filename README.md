# Wallify
Wallify fetches the album art from your currently playing Spotify track and quickly transforms it into a stunning wallpaper for your Mac. The app dynamically creates rich gradients enhanced with advanced dithering and noise filters, all based on the color palette extracted directly from the album art.

NOTE: This app uses a LOT of RAM, it renders everything in crisp HD including all effects and text. You can expect 1GB usage until optimized further (which will be very hard to do unless I chop off a ton of quality). I made this primarily for those who enjoy playing music on their MacBook whilst doing something else but I tbf I am using it on my MacBook right now whilst browsing and doing a bunch of other stuff. Just don't expect it to be lightweight.
